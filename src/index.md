## The Miskatonic Engine ##

The Miskatonic Engine is a simple, cross-browser 2D adventure game
engine. It is written in Coffeescript and designed to be clean, small,
fast, and extensible. It primarily uses the HTML5 API. The engine is
specifically written to drive my H. P. Lovecraft / My Little Pony
crossover game _The Cold Waste_ and any possible sequels, so it does not
include all the features needed by many games, such as combat or HUD.
However, it should not be difficult to add features to the engine
framework, if you wish to do so. This project is in early beta.

## EditPDF ##

An application for editing PDF files. The idea is to design a GUI specifically
to support the PDF format, thereby minimizing the inaccuracies present in other
approaches that depend on conversions between formats.

This project is written in Python 2 and uses the Qt library for the GUI and the
Freetype library to display embedded fonts. This is a work in progress, and
doesn't even have basic functionality yet. Maybe one day, when I get more free
time.
